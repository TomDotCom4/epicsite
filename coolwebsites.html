  <h1>Websites That I Think Are Cool</h1>
<br>
    <li class="link"><a href="https://based.cooking/">Based Cooking: Crowd sourced recipe website with no ads, no trackers and no bloat. Kinda ugly but better than     having huge ads and autoplaying videos.</a></li>
<br>
    <li class="link"><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap: Private and open source alternative to Google Maps. (PLEASE contribute to it!)</a></li>
<br>
    <li class="link"><a href="https://www.photopea.com/">Photopea: Decent image editing progressive web app. Don't edit any images that you wouldnt otherwise be fine with being public as it is cloud based.</a></li>
