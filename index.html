  <h1>Cool things I like</h1>


    <li class="link"><a href="https://signal.org/">Signal - Private Messenger</a><p>If you are on Whatsapp, use this instead. It actually respects you.</li>
<br>
    <li class="link"><a href="https://www.guilded.gg/">Guilded - The Discord Killer</a><p>Has so many more features than Discord and probably isn't run by as many incompetent employees (well, hopefully. It is still early days).</p></li>

  <h1>Credits</h1>

  <p>I robbed most of this site's design from a guy called <a href="https://github.com/madaidan">madaidan</a>. He has his own website which can be found <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/">here</a>. All I did was change around a few things.</p>
