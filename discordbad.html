  <h1>Everything wrong with Discord</h1>
  
  <p>
  Discord is a hell-hole of security issues, privacy nightmares, and just generally terrible things. <a href="https://cadence.moe/blog/2020-06-06-why-you-shouldnt-trust-discord">You can read all about it at this link.</a>
  <br>
  <br>However, mitigation of a lot of the telemetry collection (which still happens even if you turn it off in Discord settings) is still possible by running Discord in your browser and blocking the following with uBlock Origin:
  <br>
  <br>
  https://discord.com/api/v8/science
  <br>
  https://discord.com/api/v8/channels/*/typing
  <br>
  <br>
  The /science URL sends general telemetry to Discord (buttons you interact with, servers you click on etc) and the /typing URL I THINK sends to Discord when you are typing a message.
