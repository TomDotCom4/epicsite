  <h1>Stop Using Google Search!</h1>
  
  <p>Google is known for many things. Such things include spying on everyone, collaborating with the US Government to surveil everybody, giving the end user non-organic search results and more. Here is what you should use instead:
  <br>
  <br>
  <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> is the most popular private alternative to Google search. Some might argue its results are inferior, but they certainly aren't bad results. You can also use "abngs" which allow you to search inside any website from the omnibar, which is done by typing !w dogs if you want the Wikipedia page about dogs. There are thousands of bangs out there, so make sure you experiment.
  <br>
  <a href="https://startpage.com/">Startpage</a> is another great option. It proxies Google results for you, giving you access to fantastic search results and privacy while you do it. You can also view websites in anonymous mode, which lets you look at websites through them (it's a bit hard to explain, but think of it as using their computer to look at a website instead of your own).
