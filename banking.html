  <h1>The Best Bank for Security (in Australia)</h1>
  
  <p>
  Having a bank account is one of the necessities in life when it comes to storing your money securely and safely. Unfortunately, one of the things that can worry some people is having your bank account compromised in some way and dealing with the headaches that proceed a breach.
  <br>
  <br>
  One such method of stopping a breach is using something called ‚Äútwo factor authentication‚Äù with your bank. Most banks in Australia appear to do this as far as I‚Äôm aware, but it is usually with SMS. SMS codes sent to you are a pretty bad way to authenticate that its you, because you could very easily become a target of a SIM swapping, SIM hacking or SIM cloning attack, all of which give an attacker your details.<a href="https://www.allthingsauth.com/2018/02/27/sms-the-most-popular-and-least-secure-2fa-method/"> You can read more about SMS 2FA here </a>or <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/security/a29789903/what-is-sms/">SMS's flaws in general</a>. Email 2FA is an improvement but ultimately depends on how good your email‚Äôs security is. What you want is a dedicated 2FA app.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unfortunately, most banks don‚Äôt let you import codes into a standard 2FA app, like Aegis or Tofu Authenticator, but they do have their own proprietary apps which serve a similar purpose and are better than SMS 2FA (though that purpose is filled less effectively with proprietary tech, vs something open source like the aforementioned 2FA apps).
  <br>
  <br>
Now which banks have their own 2FA app? There are currently 4 that I know of in Australia:
  <br>
  <br>
  - <a href="https://www.macquarie.com.au/">Macquarie Bank (my pick)</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  - <a href="https://www.nab.com.au/">NAB</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  - <a href="https://www.anz.com.au/personal/">ANZ</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  - <a href="https://www.boq.com.au/">Bank of Queensland (reviews on this look bad, I wouldn‚Äôt use it)</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  The reasons I like Macquarie:
  <br>
  <br>
- Not a big 4 bank, so they are slightly less scummy
  <br>
  <br>
- Dedicated 2FA app that can also notify you of suspicious activity on your account.
  <br>
  <br>
- They are too big to fail at this point, so you won‚Äôt have to deal with a failing bank.
  <br>
  <br>
- Both their banking and their 2FA apps are very polished, even on an iPhone 6 Plus.
  <br>
  <br>
- No account keeping fees.
  <br>
  <br>
- Free withdrawals from all ATMs in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
- Many other creature comforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
Now for some negatives about Macquarie so I don't look like tooo much of a shill
  <br>
  <br>
- No Bank@Post, 
  <br>
  <br>
- The only physical branch locations are in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, so for anyone who prefers to visit a physical branch, or needs a physical branch to take an action that can only be done at one, will have some struggles. However, you can sometimes circumvent this need with some actions, like depositing hard cash. You can use another bank account (ING would be good for this purpose), use Bank@Post to deposit the money to that bank account, and then transfer the money to Macquarie. If you need cash, you can simply capitalise on the free ATM withdrawls nationwide.
