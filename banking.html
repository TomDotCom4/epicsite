  <h1>The Best Bank for Security (in Australia)</h1>
  
  <p>
  Having a bank account is one of the necessities in life when it comes to storing your money securely and safely. Unfortunately, one of the things that can worry some people is having your bank account compromised in some way and dealing with the headaches that proceed a breach.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
  One such method of stopping a breach is using something called ‚Äútwo factor authentication‚Äù with your bank. Most banks in Australia appear to do this as far as I‚Äôm aware, but it is usually with SMS. SMS codes sent to you are a pretty bad way to authenticate that its you, because you could very easily become a target of a SIM swapping, SIM hacking or SIM cloning attack, all of which give an attacker your details. You can read more about SMS 2FA, as well as SMS in general. Email 2FA is an improvement but ultimately depends on how good your email‚Äôs security is. What you want is a dedicated 2FA app.

  Unfortunately, most banks don‚Äôt let you import codes into a standard 2FA app, like Aegis or Tofu Authenticator, but they do have their own proprietary apps which offer a similar purpose (though not as much as the aforementioned solutions) which are much superior to SMS. Now which banks have this? There are currently 4 that I know of in Australia:
  <br>
  Macquarie Bank (my pick)
  <br>
  ANZ
  <br>
  NAB
  <br>
  Bank of Queensland (reviews on this look bad, I wouldn‚Äôt use it)
