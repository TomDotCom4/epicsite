  <title>Why Discord Sucks Big Time</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>Somewhat important notice (if you don't know me in real life, you can probably go about your day as you were)</h1>
  
  <p>
 Discord won't be on my phone anymore because of several privacy concerns, <a href="https://cadence.moe/blog/2020-06-06-why-you-shouldnt-trust-discord">which you can read about here.</a> I think it is a good read, regardless of your level of Discord use. I have seeked alternative methods of communication via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOyc4Rklqc">Matrix/Discord bridges.</a>, so I won't have to abandon the places I actually message on.
<br>
<br>
I will obviously still have it on my PC though because of games and stuff, but if you need to let me know of something important that is time sensitive, <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal, </a>, <a href="https://element.io/">Matrix/Element, </a> or SMS are likely the way to go.
